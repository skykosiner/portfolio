    <h1 class="title">How i use iPad Pro for school</h1>
    <h2 class="sub_title">Intro</h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      I have been using the iPad Pro for a bit now for school and I'm relay
      enjoying over using my laptop As a laptop is always going to be heavier
      then a iPad with a Smart Keyboard or even with my Logitech keyboard stick
      around to see the comparison Between the apple keyboard and the Logitech
      slim folio pro
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub_title">Good writing apps</h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      There are two writing apps i was picking between those two apps were bear
      and drafts they both had iCloud sync markdown support but my favorite
      thing about drafts is that you can import shortcuts into drafts like save
      my markdown as pdf which you can do on bear but there are other shortcuts
      you can run which you can not do on bear <br />

      channel please watch it all and subscribe to him .<br />
      I'm writing this in drafts right now and i have built this shortcut to put
      this into my blog a bit of it is from Christopher the shortcut works like
      this use the action get set name of and then shortcut input then do ask
      any time .md and the end of that then do make rich text from markdown then
      make html from rich text then do save and you pick that.then you add the
      shortcut to draft when you follow the video. But so far out of what i have
      found drafts is best app for writing i have tried bear google docs but I
      just like drafts the best.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub_title">How do i use drafts</h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      Drafts is problem one of the best text editors in the Apple ecosystem and
      yes in order to get the most out of it you do need to pay yearly but i
      think it is wroth it. The app is very organized i use it from these blog
      post to school work quick notes movies to watch and everything else. Some
      people with drafts use normal text but i use markdown now if you do not
      know what that is check out this website
      <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/"
        >github markdown guides</a
      >
      markdown is amazing and drafts has some amazing support for it. The I find
      my self the most organized is by using tags in drafts and search and if
      you have a windows computer like what i have now you can not see your
      documents through a drafts window app.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub_title">Coding on the iPad Pro</h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      The iPad Pro is amazing at everything but coding i code in python,html,css
      and JavaScript. The iPad does have a app called coda Which it what i use
      when i code on here not my laptop it is a good app but my problem is that
      file organization is terrible but apart from that it works fine when
      traveling or just no near my laptop.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub_title">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="main_text">
      The iPad Pro is a amazing device for school but for most people it is just
      overkill it is overkill for the only reason i have it is because I'm a
      really big tech geek. Most people should just buy the iPad model that is
      relay powerful. The iPad Pro is more powerful then some mackbook pros in
      geek bench the think i just don't get is why apple wont drop intel for
      there laptops. I know this is late but i did just get this before i had
      iPad Air 2 64gb and before that iPad mini 2 and the mini 2 got ready slow
      but the air 2 still worked fine for me for school it was fast for typing
      and everything my dad still has the iPad Air 2 and uses it for email work
      and that type of stuff and the iPad Air 2 is still amazing.
